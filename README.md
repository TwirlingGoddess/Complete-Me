## A binary search tree

This project explores the capabilities and inner workings of a binary search tree.

It explores actions on a tree's node using methods such as insert(), search(), suggest(), wordCount(), populate(), and contains().

Feel free to import this file as a node module to help you implement auto-completely in form fields using the search() method.

This binary search tree is also fully tested.
